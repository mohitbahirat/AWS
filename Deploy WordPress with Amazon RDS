You need to edit two areas of configuration.

First, edit the database configuration by changing the following lines:
 DB_NAME: “wordpress”

● DB_USER: The name of the user you created in the database in the previous module

● DB_PASSWORD: The password for the user you created in the previous module.

● DB_HOST: The hostname of the database that you found in the previous module.

sudo cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/
sudo service httpd restart
